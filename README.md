# FinalTurboTypist
TurboTypist is an effective and minimalistic desktop application that tests, tracks, and improves your typing speed with a variety of modes, timers, and competitive features to keep users coming back to refine their skills and hit new high scores.
All aspects of this project were done by me with the help of online documentation, videos, and forums.
No code was directly copied and all referenced code was used with a thorough understanding of the concepts behind them.
All icons are copyright-free and taken from flaticon.com.
